# Intorduction

This is a MySql and PHP test task sent by raintree systems. 
I am using Visual studio code and Wamp to write my code. I also used
"PHP Intellisense" extension by Felix Becker and "MySQL" extension by jun Han. 

# Difficulties

When trying to run script.php for the first time I faced difficulties I got an error: "fatal error: Uncaught Error: Class "mysqli" not found". I fixed it after googleing and finding a solution on stackoverflow. The problem was with php.ini file in PHP installation directory.
