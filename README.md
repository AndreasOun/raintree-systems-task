# Introduction

This test task was assigned by raintree systems and involved working with MySQL and PHP. For my development environment, I utilized Visual Studio Code and Wamp. To enhance my coding experience, I integrated two extensions: "PHP Intellisense" by Felix Becker and "MySQL" by jun Han. Completing this exercise took approximately 7 hours.

# Challenges Encountered

While I have experience with JavaScript and its ecosystem, PHP is relatively new to me, which presented a few challenges. I believe in maintaining transparency, so I would like to share the difficulties I faced during the task:

Setting up the database initially posed some difficulties. I made a few mistakes in creating the tables and used incorrect queries, leading to some issues.

When executing the script.php for the first time, I encountered an error: "Fatal error: Class 'mysqli' not found." After some research and finding a solution on Stack Overflow, I resolved the issue by modifying the php.ini file in the PHP installation directory.

Although the exercise progressed smoothly, the majority of my time was spent on research and Google searches. It involved a lot of trial and error as I worked to grasp various concepts and techniques.
